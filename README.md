#### [vEGU2021: SC4.6 Solving differential equations in parallel with Julia | Thu, 29 Apr, 16:00‚Äì17:00 (CEST)](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/38986)

üëâ **Organisation notes:**
- üí° All material presented during the short course will be uploaded here and made available to participants 5 days prior to the event on this repository.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Live participation to this short course requires [registration to EGU's main meeting](https://egu21.eu/register.html).
- Due to the time-limited course schedule (60 min), an interactive overview will cover the course's [objectives](#objectives) replacing an extensive hands-on.
- Further interests in solving PDEs with Julia on GPUs‚ùìSign-up (free) for a hands-on workshop at [JuliaCon2021](https://juliacon.org/2021/).

----
This short course covers trendy areas in modern geocomputing with broad geoscientific applications. The physical processes governing natural systems' evolution are often mathematically described as systems of differential equations. A performant numerical implementation of the solving algorithm leveraging modern hardware is key and permits to tackle problems that were technically not possible a decade ago.

## Objectives
The goal of this short course is to offer an interactive overview on how to solve systems of differential equations in parallel on GPUs using the [Julia language]. [Julia] combines high-level language simplicity and low-level language performance. The resulting codes and applications are fast, short and readable \[[1][JuliaCon20a], [2][JuliaCon20b], [3][JuliaCon19]\]. We will design and implement a numerical algorithm that predicts ice flow dynamics over mountainous topography (Greenland) using a high-performance computing approach:

![Greenland ice cap](docs/greenland_1.png)

The online course consists of 2 parts:
1. You will learn about the [Julia language], parallel and distributed computing and iterative solvers.
2. You will implement a PDE solver to predict ice flow dynamics on real topography.

By the end of this short course, you will:
- Have a GPU PDE solver that predicts ice-flow;
- Have a Julia code that achieves similar performance than legacy codes (C, CUDA, MPI);
- Know how the Julia language solves the "two-language problem";
- Be able to leverage the computing power of modern GPU accelerated servers and supercomputers.

## Structure of the repository
The course repository lists following folders and items:
- the [data](data) folder contains various low resolution Greenland input data (bedrock topography, surface elevation, ice thickness, masks, ...) downscaled from [BedMachine Greenland v3] - note the filenames include grid resolution information `(nx, ny)`;
- the [docs](docs) folder contains documentation linked in the [README](README.md);
- the output folder _will_ contain the various code output, mainly figures in png format;
- the [scripts](scripts) folder contains the scripts this course is about üéâ
- the [`Manifest.toml`](Manifest.toml) and [`Project.toml`](Project.toml) files are Julia project files tracking the used packages and enabling a reproducible environment.

## Getting started
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to the time limitation, the short course will not walk through the [Getting started](#getting-started) steps. These are meant to provide directions to the participant willing to actively participate and try out the examples during the short course. It is warmly recommended to perform the [Getting started](#getting-started) steps before the beginning of the workshop.

The provided directions will get you started with:
1. [Installing Julia](#installing-julia); Two configurations are presented: 
- running Julia from the [terminal with an external text editor](#terminal--external-editor)
- running Julia from [VS Code](#vs-code)

2. [Running the scripts](#running-the-scripts) from the course repository.

> üëâ _Note: This course relies on Julia v1.5.X. The install configuration are tested on a MacBook Pro running macOS 10.15.7 and a Linux GPU server running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS._

### Installing Julia
Check you have an active internet connexion, head to https://julialang.org/downloads/ and download Julia v1.5.4 for your platform following the install directions provided under [help] if needed.

Alternatively, open a terminal and download the binaries (select the one for your platform):
```sh
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/winnt/x64/1.5/julia-1.5.4-win64.exe # Windows
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/mac/x64/1.5/julia-1.5.4-mac64.dmg # macOS
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.5/julia-1.5.4-linux-x86_64.tar.gz # Linux x86
tar -xzf julia-1.5.4-<win64, mac64, linux-x86_64>.tar.gz # selecting your platform
```
Then add following lines in your `.bashrc`, `.profile`, or `config` file:
```sh
vim ~/.bashrc
PATH=<path-to>/julia-1.5.4/bin/:$PATH
export JULIA_CUDA_USE_BINARYBUILDER=false
```

#### Terminal + external editor
Ensure you have a text editor with syntax highlighting support for Julia. From within the terminal, type
```sh
julia
```
and you should be all set.

#### VS Code
If you'd enjoy a more IDE type of environment, [check out VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Follow the [installation directions](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode#getting-started) for the [Julia VS Code extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org).

### Running the scripts
To get started with the course,
1. clone (or download the ZIP archive) the course repository ([help here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
```sh
git clone https://github.com/luraess/julia-parallel-course-EGU21.git
```
2. Navigate to `julia-parallel-course-EGU21` (`cd julia-parallel-course-EGU21`)

3. From the terminal, launch Julia with the `--project` flag to read-in project environment related informations such as used packages
```sh
julia --project
```
3. From VS Code, follow the [instructions from the documentation](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/gettingstarted/) to get started.

--
Now that you launched Julia, you should be in the [Julia REPL]. We now need to ensure all the packages we need to be installed before using them. To do so, enter the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) by typing `]`. Then, instantiate the project which should trigger the download of the packages. Exit the Pkg mode with CRTL+C:
```julia-repl
julia> 

(julia-parallel-course-EGU21) pkg> st
Status `~/julia-parallel-course-EGU21/Project.toml`
  [4138dd39] JLD
  [85f8d34a] NCDatasets
  [91a5bcdd] Plots
  [de0858da] Printf

(julia-parallel-course-EGU21) pkg> instantiate
   Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
   Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
   # [...]

julia> 
```
To test your install, go to the [scripts](scripts) folder and run the [`iceflow.jl`](scripts/iceflow.jl) code. Note that you can execute shell commands from within the repl first typing `;`. From within the 
```julia-repl
julia> ;

shell> cd scripts/

julia> include("iceflow.jl")
```
You should then see two figures saved in a newly created output folder, the second being the comparison between modelled and observed ice thickness distribution over Greenland:
